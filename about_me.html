            Hey there! I'm Paula, a game designer, developer and illustrator
            from Chile.<br />
            <br />
            My journey has led me to explore a wide range of skills
            independently, including programming, illustration, animation, and
            writing. This continuous learning process as well as my degree in
            integral design have made me see projects in a holistic and
            interdisciplinary perspective. I enjoy making connections between
            all the different parts of a project. <br />
            <br />
            I believe that games can positively impact on people's lives,
            connecting them with their emotions and experiences, learning about
            themselves through someone else’s story. My goal is to participate
            in this kind of meaningful projects, making game design choices that
            create a fully emotional and psychological experience for the
            player, promoting mental health and introspection. Some of my
            favorite indie games that achieve this are Spiritfarer, Celeste and
            Gris.<br />
            <br />
            One the achievements I’m most proud of is that in 2023 I was
            selected as a recipient for the International Game Developers
            Association (IGDA) Foundation's Virtual Exchange program, being a
            part of the International Scholars cohort, and then got the chance
            to attend GDC 2024 thanks to their support.<br />
            <br />
            When I'm not working, I'm usually painting, reading, watching TV
            shows, playing beautiful games, singing or spending time with my
            friends, family and cats.

            <br />
            Hey there! I'm Paula, a game designer, storyteller, and artist from
            Chile.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a background in user-centered design, I approach each project
            with a mix of creativity and analytical thinking and enjoy bridging
            the gap between its different aspects. I like to contribute to
            projects that challenge the boundaries of game design and
            innovation, creating immersive gameplay experiences that resonate
            with players.
            <br />
            <br />
            I believe that games can positively impact on people's lives,

            health, interculturality and introspection.

            <br />
            <!--Achievements-->
            In 2023, I was selected for the IGDA Foundation’s Virtual Exchange,
            a competitive mentorship program, being part of the International
            Scholars cohort, and later attended GDC 2024 with their support.
            More recently, my thesis project was nominated for the Best Student
            Game Awards at the Student Games Festival 2025 in Warsaw, Poland. I
            was also selected for Pro Helvetia’s 2026 She Got Game mentorship
            program, focused on female-empowering games.
